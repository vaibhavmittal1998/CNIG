Computer Networking Information Group MIET Meerut
About :- 
The primary focus of Computer Networking Information Group (CNIG) at MIET Meerut is to enable verifiable and reproducible research in the areas of Computer Networks; specially Network Congestion Control, Active Queue Management, Protocol Design and Development, Internet of Things and Future Internet Architecture. The projects handled by this group are all open-source, and active contributions from the community towards enhacing these projects are welcome!
CNIG has been instrumental in developing benchmark tools that can be used to analyze the working of existing or upcoming network protocols. These tools are developed with an aim to simplify the process of protocol design and engineering.

Goals:-

-The main goal of networking is "Resource sharing", and it is to make all programs, data and equipment available to anyone on the network without the regard to the physical location of the resource and the user.
-A second goal is to provide high reliability by having alternative sources of supply. For example, all files could be replicated on two or three machines, so if one of them is unavailable, the other copies could be available.
-Another goal is saving money. Small computers have a much better price/performance ratio than larger ones. Mainframes are roughly a factor of ten times faster than the fastest single chip microprocessors, but they cost thousand times more. This imbalance has caused many system designers to build systems consisting of powerful personal computers, one per user, with data kept on one or more shared file server machines. This goal leads to networks with many computers located in the same building. Such a network is called a LAN (local area network).
-Another closely related goal is to increase the systems performance as the work load increases by just adding more processors. With central mainframes, when the system is full, it must be replaced by a larger one, usually at great expense and with even greater disruption to the users.
-Computer networks provide a powerful communication medium. A file that was updated or modified on a network can be seen by the other users on the network immediately.
